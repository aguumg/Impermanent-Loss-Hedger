# Impermanent Loss Hedging in Constant Product AMMs

This repository contains the code and simulations presented in the blog post and paper:  
**"Impermanent Loss from a Quantitative Perspective: Static Replication and Hedging via Options"**

We develop a simple yet powerful framework to model impermanent loss (IL) in constant product automated market makers (CPMMs), such as Uniswap v2. Using Python and Jupyter, we simulate:

- The dynamic value of liquidity provider (LP) positions
- The IL incurred under price movements
- A static hedging strategy based on a long strangle of European options

The goal is to provide DeFi researchers, quant developers, and protocol designers with an educational and adaptable tool for exploring IL mitigation strategies.
